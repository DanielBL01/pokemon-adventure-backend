# Pokemon Adventure

Use the PokeAPI to create a pokemon simulator with a Pokedex to learn all about Pokemon!
Since there are so many Pokemon, this project will only use the first 151 Pokemon from the Kanto Region (First Generation)

The default city or town should be Pallet Town.
Use the PokeAPI to query for all pokemon that can be found in Pallet Town
